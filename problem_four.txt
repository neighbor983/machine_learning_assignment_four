4.	Develop a logistic regression-like algorithm for the following cost function.

Y = 1 - Cost function goes from 100 to 0 linearly as hypothesis function goes from 0 to 1

Y = 0 - Cost function goes from 0 to 100 linearly as hypothesis function goes from 0 to 1

Compare results with those of the standard logistic algorithm.
