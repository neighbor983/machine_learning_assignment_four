3.	Plot both hypothesis function 0 < x < 6. Compare and explain the two results 
obtained. 


For the given training set both of the Linear and Logistic hypothesis functions 
cross h(θ) = y = 0.5 close to each other. The Linear function reaches y = 0.5 
when x ~ 2.7 hours of studying. The Logistic function reaches y = 0.5 when x ~ 
2.5 hours of studying.

The Logistic function will always return us a h(θ) between 0 and 1. If we were 
to add a large sample like x = 25 hours of studying and y = 1 to the data set 
the optimal line when using a Linear function will be significantly affected. 
The Logistic function is a sigmoid function which will never exceed one so 
adding a large sample like x = 25 hours of studying and y = 1 to the training 
data would not have a significant effect on the optimal line. It is coincidence 
that both of the functions will reached y = .5 at approximately the same point.
