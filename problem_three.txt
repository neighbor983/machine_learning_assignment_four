3.	Plot both hypothesis function 0 < x < 6. Compare and explain the two results 
obtained. 


For the given training set both of the Linear and Logistic functions cross 
y = 0.5 close to each other. The Linear function reaches y = 0.5 when x ~ 2.7 
hours of studying. The Logistic function reaches y = 0.5 when x ~ 2.5 hours of 
studying.

The Logistic Regression algorithm will always return us a h(theta) between 0 and 
1. If we were to add a large x of 25 hours with a y = 1 to the data set the 
optimal line will have to be significant lowered. The Logistic Regression 
alogrithm uses a sigmoid function that will never exceed one so adding a large x 
of 25 hours with a y = 1 to the data set would not have a significant effect on 
the optimal line.
