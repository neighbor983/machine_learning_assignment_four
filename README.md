## Assignment 4

A group of 20 students studied 0 to 6 hours for the exam.  Some passed and others failed. Results are given below (Data is taken from Wikipedia).

| Student | Hours Studied  - x | Result (0 – fail, 1 – pass) - y |

1.	Determine the optimal linear hypothesis using linear regression to predict if a student passes or not based on the number hours studied.
2.	Determine the optimal logistic hypothesis using logistic regression to predict if a student passes or not based on the number hours studied.
3.	Plot both hypothesis function 0 < x < 6. Compare and explain the two results obtained. 
4.	Develop a logistic regression-like algorithm for the following cost function.
Y = 1 - Cost function goes from 100 to 0 linearly as hypothesis function goes from 0 to 1
Y = 0 - Cost function goes from 0 to 100 linearly as hypothesis function goes from 0 to 1
Compare results with those of the standard logistic algorithm.
